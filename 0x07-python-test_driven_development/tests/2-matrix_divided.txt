++++++++++++++++++++++++

use of 2-matrix_divided
Divides all elements of a matrix

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Import module

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [
... [6, 9, 12],
... [15, 18, 21]... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[2.0, 3.0, 4.0], [4.0, 6.0, 7.0]]

test for division by zero
>>> try:

>>> matrix =[[6, 9, 12], [15, 18, 21]]
... print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
division by zero

test for wrong data type for div

>>> try:
>>> matrix =[[6, 9, 12], [15, 18, 21]]
... print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'bye'))
division must be a number

test for diff data type from integer
>>> try:
>>> matrix =[[6, 9, 12], [15, 'num', 21]]
... print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2)) 

matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
